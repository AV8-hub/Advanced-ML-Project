## Sports Ball Image Segmentation
3A ENSAE 2023/2024 : Advanced ML Project

BORDES Martin and ROSUNEE Avicha√Ø

This project focuses on leveraging neural network models for accurate image segmentation of sports balls using the COCO dataset. We explore state-of-the-art architectures, including U-Net, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLab, adapting them to diverse sports scenarios. The goal is to enhance sports analytics by providing precise segmentation in dynamic settings.
