## Sports Ball Image Segmentation

This project focuses on leveraging neural network models for accurate image segmentation of sports balls using the COCO dataset. We explore state-of-the-art architectures, including U-Net, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLab, adapting them to diverse sports scenarios. The goal is to enhance sports analytics by providing precise segmentation in dynamic settings.
